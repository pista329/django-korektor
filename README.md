Django Korektor
===============

Django Korektor is a brigam based "Did you mean?" proof of concept.

> Have you ever heard about Google's "Did you mean" feature? Django Korektor is a simplified proof of concept based od bigrams intersection between spellchecked query and database set.

Django Korektor contains optimized database models. Learning management commands to import yoir huge language datasets and finally test spellcheck. It finds closest brigams match, corrects and preserves any separators.

Theory

Cassical Damereau errors introduced by F.J. Damereau in 1964:
- Substitution 
	``ALPHABET -> ALPHSBET``
- Deletion 
	``ALPHABET -> ALPHBET``
- Insertion 
	``ALPHABET -> ALPHAABET``
- Transposition 
	``ALPHABET -> ALPHBAET``

What is a bigram?
---
A bigram or digram is every sequence of two adjacent elements in a string of tokens, which are typically letters, syllables, or words; they are n-grams for n=2. The frequency distribution of bigrams in a string are commonly used for simple statistical analysis of text in many applications, including in computational linguistics, cryptography, speech recognition, and so on. Source: [Wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bigram)

For example: "Spellcheck" broken down to bigrams will result in [Sp, pe, el, ll, lc, ch, he, ec, ck]

Example use:
---
``./manage.py djkorektor --do-import-word="Bigrams are fun! It is raining, let's dance together. It will be my pleasure." --locale=en_US``

Please note
---
- Django Korektor can't fix a word if you did't learned it. Basically you need to import huge language specific dataset of correct phrases. For example a lot of newspaper articles (by constant learning from any rss feed). 
- Django Korektor will only fix certain misspells between words. For example "It is fan to dance" will result as correct phrase.
